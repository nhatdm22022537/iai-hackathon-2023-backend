# IAI Hackathon 2023 - Testeria - NodeJS Backend
20mil will be in our hands.

## Getting started
- Clone this repo. Set the active directory to the newly generated folder.
- Install `npm` and then install required libraries:
```
npm install
```
- Copy and change `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file (optional).
- In the `config` folder, a JSON file that contains a Firebase Service Account (`firebaseAdminPK.json`) is needed. Use your self-generated file if you want to use your own Firebase database, or to use the official database, use the file that was secretly given.
- Run the server with:
```
npm start
```
- If you are running in a development environment, run the server with:
```
npm run dev
```
- If running in a server, run the server by:
    - Build: `npm run build`
    - Serve: `npm run serve`
    - Use `serve` whenever the server restarts, use `build` whenever the code changed.

## Usage
### General
- The route can be found in the `routes.js` file.
- The front-end should try to validate the user input first (although we tried to validate as thorough as possible).
- All request must be in JSON raw format like this (the `uid` or `data` is not needed every time but just add for safety measures):
```
{
    "uid": <the user's current uid>,
    "data": <request data, required data>
}
```
- All response will be in JSON raw format like this:
```
{
    "msg": <status, could be ok/err>,
    "data": <additional response data>
}
```

### Game module
- This module uses WebSocket (aka WS), specifically Socket.io for the most part.
- Each user will now be identified by a socket ID, and multiple socket ID can be used by a single user at the same time (i.e. an user can join multiple game at the same time).
- The event name starting with `post-` is from client (you post the requests to the server), `get-` is from server (you get the updates from the server).
- Note: You would need the Flask server running to be able to check for the answer.

#### Route `/game/get`
Request (POST): Get the current player status of this game (of course not including other players "sensitive" data).

This should be (mostly) used whenever the user join in the first time, or when the user reconnect (to get the lost game data). The intended way to get the data in real-time is through listening to WS events.

- Requirement:
    - The room's id.
- Body:
```
{
    "uid": "f2iEv5kKrtOua3bazpVFfW5t4hB2",

                "ready": 0,
                "ended": false
            },
            "hPnZoOJ5K3VPD9BWgo7KtxkuUBC3": {
                "online": false,
                "ready": 9,
                "ended": false
            }
        }
    }
}
```
